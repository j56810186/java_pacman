# java_pacman
My object-oriented programming final project.
Then I change the map and use it on CCA(commerce career ambassador)'s activity.
This is the new version.

You can run this game with the "CCA_pacman.jar" file.
Or, if you want to run the code in eclipse, the main method is in "Game.java" file.
